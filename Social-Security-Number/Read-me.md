The AMKA (Social Security number) is in essence the work and insurance ID of every employee, pensioner and dependent member of their family in Greece.
In this project we ask user to enter his "AMKA" and the programm check if it's a valid Social Security Number. 
By its details, we get informed for users gender and date of birth.
